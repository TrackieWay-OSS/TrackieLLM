# Trackie / Trackway Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming project for everyone, we commit to making participation in Trackie / Trackway a harassment-free experience for contributors and maintainers alike. We do not tolerate harassment of project participants in any form.

We expect all participants to behave professionally and respectfully, to help create a community that is inclusive, constructive, and safe.

## Our Standards

- Be considerate, courteous and respectful in all communications.
- Use welcoming and inclusive language; assume good faith.
- Show empathy and respect differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Provide constructive feedback and avoid personal attacks.
- Respect people’s privacy and request consent before sharing private information.

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Harassment, intimidation, or threats of violence.
- Derogatory comments or slurs related to age, race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, disability, or any protected characteristic.
- Public or private harassment, stalking, or doxxing.
- Sustained disruption of project discussions or workflows.
- Posting sexually explicit content or other content clearly unrelated to the project.
- Reprisal or retaliation against anyone who reports a concern in good faith.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Trackie / Trackway project, including but not limited to:

- GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, and discussions.
- Official project chatrooms, mailing lists, and forums.
- Community events, meetups, and developer gatherings.
- Any other public or private communications mediated by project teams.

## Reporting an Incident
If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it as soon as possible. Maintain confidentiality where appropriate.

You may report incidents in one of two ways:

1. **Open a private issue** in the project repository and mark it clearly for the maintainers (recommended):
   - https://github.com/phkaiser13/TrackieLLM/issues  
   - Please set the issue title to include `[CODE-OF-CONDUCT]` so maintainers can triage quickly.

2. **Email the project lead directly** (confidential):
   - **pedro.henrique@vytruve.org**

When filing a report, please include as many details as possible:
- What happened (concise description).
- Date/time and location (links to issue, PR, chat log, or event).
- Usernames or real names of people involved.
- Relevant screenshots, logs, or copies of messages (if available).
- Names of any witnesses and whether you consent to them being contacted.

## Response & Enforcement
- All reports will be handled promptly and with discretion.
- The project maintainers will acknowledge receipt of reports within a reasonable time and will investigate in good faith.
- The maintainers may take actions including: private warnings, mediation, temporary or permanent removal from project privileges, or public notices — depending on the severity and veracity of the report.
- The project will follow a non-retaliation policy: anyone reporting in good faith will not face reprisals from maintainers or contributors.

## Responsibilities
**Project maintainers** are responsible for:
- Acting on reports in a timely, fair, and confidential manner.
- Maintaining records of reports and actions taken.
- Communicating outcomes to parties involved, when appropriate and safe.

**Contributors and community members** are responsible for:
- Following this Code of Conduct in all project spaces.
- Helping to create and maintain a welcoming environment.
- Reporting violations in good faith.

## Appeals
If you believe a sanction was unfair or incorrectly applied, you may appeal by contacting the project lead at **pedro.henrique@vytruve.org**. Appeals will be reviewed by an independent maintainer or designated reviewer where possible.
