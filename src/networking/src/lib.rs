 * This file is the main library entry point for the 'networking' crate.
 * It is responsible for managing all network communications for the
 * TrackieLLM application. This includes establishing connections, managing a
 * pool of reusable connections, and handling the application-level protocol
 * for data exchange.
 *
 * The crate is designed with performance and scalability in mind, using
 * asynchronous I/O and modern networking patterns. The main components are:
 *
 * - `protocol`: Defines the structure of messages, serialization/deserialization
 *   logic, and the overall communication protocol.
 * - `connection_pool`: Manages a pool of active network connections to reduce
 *   the overhead of repeatedly establishing new TCP connections.
 *
 * Since the corresponding C header files are empty, this is a Rust-native
 * implementation intended to be the primary provider of networking services.
 *
 * Dependencies:
 *   - log: For structured logging of network events.
 *   - thiserror: For ergonomic error handling.
 *   - tokio: As the asynchronous runtime for non-blocking I/O.
 *   - bytes: For efficient network buffer management.

//! # TrackieLLM Networking Crate
//!
//! Provides high-performance, asynchronous networking services for the application.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! This crate is built on the `tokio` asynchronous runtime. It uses a
//! `NetworkManager` as the central service to handle outgoing requests. The
//! manager utilizes a `ConnectionPool` to efficiently manage TCP connections
//! to various endpoints. All communication follows the rules and structures
//! defined in the `protocol` module.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use networking::{NetworkConfig, NetworkManager, protocol::Request};
//! use std::time::Duration;
//!
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//!     let config = NetworkConfig {
//!         default_timeout: Duration::from_secs(10),
//!         max_connections_per_host: 10,
//!     };
//!
//!     let network_manager = NetworkManager::new(config);
//!
//!     let request = Request::Ping;
//!     let response = network_manager.send_request("my-service.local:8080", request).await?;
//!
//!     println!("Received response: {:?}", response);
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
