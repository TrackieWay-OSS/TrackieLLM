 * This file provides a safe Rust interface for running models in the ONNX
 * (Open Neural Network Exchange) format. These models are typically used for
 * non-LLM tasks such as computer vision, audio processing, and other
 * specialized neural network applications.
 *
 * The `OnnxRunner` is designed to work in tandem with the C-based model loader.
 * It expects that an ONNX model has been loaded via `tk_model_loader_load_model`
 * and that a handle to the model context is provided. The runner then focuses
 * purely on the inference task: preparing input tensors, executing the model,
 * and interpreting the output tensors.
 *
 * While the C API headers provided a detailed interface for an LLM runner, a
 * generic ONNX runner was not specified. Therefore, this module defines a
 * Rust-native API structure that would logically connect to a generic C-level
 * inference backend for ONNX models in the future.
 *
 * Dependencies:
 *   - crate::AiModelsError: For shared error handling.
 *   - log: For structured logging.
