 *
 * This file provides the core logic for analyzing the performance of a single
 * AI model. It defines the data structures for a detailed performance report
 * and implements the `analyze_model` function, which serves as the main
 * entry point for the analysis process.
 *
 * The analysis process simulated here involves:
 * 1. Loading the specified model.
 * 2. Iterating through a dataset.
 * 3. Running inference for each data point.
 * 4. Recording key performance indicators (KPIs) such as latency, throughput,
 *    and accuracy.
 * 5. Aggregating these KPIs into a final `ModelPerformanceReport`.
 *
 * The actual model loading and inference are mocked but the structure is
 * designed to be integrated with a real model runtime (e.g., ONNX Runtime,
 * GGML runner) in the future.
 *
 * Dependencies:
 *   - crate::ModelSpec: For specifying the model to be analyzed.
 *   - log: For structured logging.
 *   - thiserror: For ergonomic error handling.
