 * File: src/deployment/package_manager.rs
 *
 * This file implements the logic for managing update packages. This includes
 * downloading packages from a given URL, verifying their integrity and
 * authenticity, and finally installing them. This is a security-critical
 * module, and the implementation outlines a secure workflow, even though the
 * underlying cryptographic and installation operations are mocked.
 *
 * The key functions are:
 * - `download_package`: Simulates downloading a package file.
 * - `verify_package`: Performs two critical security checks:
 *   1.  Verifies the SHA-256 checksum of the package against a known value.
 *   2.  Verifies a digital signature (e.g., Ed25519) of the package against a
 *       trusted public key. This ensures the package has not been tampered
 *       with and originates from the legitimate developer.
 * - `install_package`: Simulates the process of applying the update, such as
 *   replacing the main application binary.
 *
 * Dependencies:
 *   - log: For structured logging.
 *   - thiserror: For ergonomic error handling.
 *   - sha2, ed25519-dalek, signature: (Conceptual) For checksums and digital signatures.
